# Client Intro

### SPA

Waline brings support for SPA (Single Page Application). If you are using `history.pushState` in website, you can use the `update()` method of the `Waline()` instance to refresh the configuration of the comment area, or you can use the `destory()` method on the instance to destroy Waline. See [SPA Support](./) for details.
